# 🧠 Story Point Guide for Scrum Planning

Story points help us estimate **relative effort, complexity, and risk** — not actual hours.  
We use the **Fibonacci sequence** for point sizing: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21`.

---

## 🎯 What Story Points Are
- ✅ A team estimate of how hard a task is (not how long)
- ✅ Used to plan sprint capacity and track team velocity
- ✅ Based on complexity, unknowns, and size

---

## 🚫 What Story Points Are NOT
- ❌ Hours or exact time estimates
- ❌ Assigned by one person
- ❌ A measure of a developer's speed

## 📊 Story Point Scale (Fibonacci)

| Points | Meaning                                       | Example                                |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Very small, trivial task                      | Fix a typo, change a button color      |
| 2      | Small, minor work                             | Update validation on a form            |
| 3      | Medium complexity                             | Add new field to form + backend update |
| 5      | Medium-large effort, some coordination needed | Forgot password flow                   |
| 8      | Large, some risk or unknowns                  | Build SignalR-based real-time chat     |
| 13     | Very large, complex or multi-domain           | Implement secure file upload + preview |
| 21     | Epic – too large, needs to be broken down     | Full user management system            |

## 🧩 Estimation Process

1. During sprint planning, each dev estimates the issue privately.
2. Reveal points together (use Planning Poker or silently).
3. Discuss differences and agree on a final number.

## 💡 Tips

- Don’t overthink it — it's about **relative** sizing.
- Split stories >13 into smaller issues.
- Revisit and re-estimate if scope changes mid-sprint.
