# Research
**UX Research (User Experience Research)** is the systematic investigation of user behaviors, needs, and motivations through various methodologies. The goal is to inform the design process and ensure that the product being built is useful, usable, and desirable for its target audience.

It typically involves:

- **Understanding Users:** Who are they? What are their goals? What challenges do they face?
    
- **Understanding Context:** In what situations will they use the product? What are their environments like?
    
- **Identifying Pain Points:** What frustrates them with existing solutions or current workflows?
    
- **Validating Ideas:** Testing design concepts and prototypes with real users to gather feedback and make improvements before significant development effort is invested.
    

Common methods in UX Research include:

- **Interviews:** One-on-one conversations with potential users.
    
- **Surveys:** Gathering quantitative data from a larger user base.
    
- **Usability Testing:** Observing users as they attempt to complete tasks with a prototype or a live product.
    
- **Card Sorting / Tree Testing:** Understanding how users mentally organize information.
    
- **Competitive Analysis:** Studying competitors' products to identify strengths and weaknesses.
    
- **Persona Creation:** Developing archetypal user profiles based on research data.
    
- **Journey Mapping:** Visualizing the steps a user takes to achieve a goal.
    

In essence, UX research ensures that design decisions are backed by data and user insights, rather than just assumptions or personal preferences.


# üß± What is a UX Wireframe?

UX wireframes are **visual guides** that represent the **skeletal framework** of a website or application. They are intentionally **low-fidelity** and typically **black and white**, focusing on:

- Layout  
- Content placement  
- Functionality  
- User flow  

> üéØ Focus: structure and interaction‚Äînot visual aesthetics.

---

### ‚ùì What Do Wireframes Answer?

- What elements will be on this page/screen?  
- Where will they be located?  
- What will happen when a user interacts with this button/field?  
- What is the primary path a user takes to complete a task?

> üèóÔ∏è Think of it like an **architectural blueprint** for a house *before* interior design.

## üß© Common Characteristics

- **Low Fidelity**: Often hand-drawn sketches or basic digital mockups.  
- **No Color, Fonts, or Graphics**: Placeholder text only (e.g., _Lorem Ipsum_, _Header Text_).  
- **Focus on Functionality**: Shows buttons, input fields, nav elements, etc.  
- **Annotations**: Includes notes to explain purpose and interaction.

## üîç Key Elements in a Wireframe

- **Layout** ‚Äì Placement of all elements  
- **Content Placeholders** ‚Äì e.g., _Username_, _Email_, _Sign Up_  
- **Functionality** ‚Äì Inputs, buttons, checkboxes, links  
- **Flow (Implied)** ‚Äì What happens when a user clicks or types

## üß† Purpose

UX wireframes are for:
- Stakeholder discussion and validation  
- UI designers and developers as a **structural blueprint**  
- Ensuring the right user flow before any styling decisions
