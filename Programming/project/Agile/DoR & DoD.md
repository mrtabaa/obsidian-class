"Definition of Done" criteria (e.g., "Wireframes approved by Product Owner")

	**"Definition of Ready" and "Definition of Done":**

- **Definition of Ready (for a User Story entering a Sprint):** The user story should be refined enough that design tasks (e.g., wireframes, initial mockups) might already be complete or at least clearly defined. This means some design work might happen _before_ the sprint formally starts or in an earlier sprint.
	- **EPIC:** Product owner & Scrum master
	- **Story & tasks:** Developers
    
- **Definition of Done (for a User Story completing a Sprint):** It should include visual design approval and front-end implementation.
	- **Sprint:** Product owner, scrum master
	- **Story:** Stakeholders, product owner & scrum master
	- **Task:** Scrum Master has approved it. (DoD)
