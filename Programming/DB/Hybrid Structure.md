### **1. Offload the Right Workloads to MongoDB**

MongoDB should handle:

- **Chats / messages**
    
- **Activity logs / audit trails**
    
- **Dynamic user profiles**
    
- **Job descriptions, milestone documents**
    
- **Proof-of-work logs**
    

These are **write-heavy, flexible, and nested**, which Mongo handles faster than EF/PostgreSQL — and this reduces read/write load from PostgreSQL altogether.

### **2. EF Core 9’s Job in the Hybrid Setup**

EF Core with PostgreSQL now focuses on **structured, transactional, and reportable data**:

- **Users and Identity (optional)**
    
- **Payouts & Escrow**
    
- **Invoices**
    
- **Admin analytics**
    
- **Disputes**
    

This smaller, focused workload means EF won’t be overwhelmed — and **you can scale it efficiently using the checklist** I gave earlier, without the burden of handling complex dynamic structures.

### **3. New Performance Opportunities in Hybrid Setup**

|Strategy|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Split read/write load**|Offload read-heavy stuff (chat, profiles, listings) to Mongo, reducing PostgreSQL query pressure|
|**Avoid joins by duplicating reference data in Mongo**|E.g., store `JobTitle`, `ClientName` in chat docs — avoid needing cross-DB joins|
|**Use Mongo for write spikes**|Job proposals, chat messages, feedback — Mongo can absorb high insert volume|
|**Lean on PostgreSQL for consistency-critical logic**|Payouts, role-based permissions, reporting — EF+Postgres shines here|
|**Materialize reports**|Use PostgreSQL for daily/weekly rollups, keep Mongo lightweight and real-time|
|**Add caching or Redis layer if needed**|For both sides if specific dashboards or leaderboards are queried often|
